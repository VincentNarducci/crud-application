# crud-application
Attempt at creating a CRUD front end interface which didn't totally get there :(

1.	As a team, create a full CRUD application of your choice. If you can use an existing API, use AJAX to interact with it. However, you do not have to use an API. If you do not use an API, store the entities you will create, read, update, and delete in an array.
a.	Application should have at least 1 entity per team member
b.	Use a form to add new entities
c.	Build a way for users to update or delete entities
d.	Use Bootstrap and CSS to style your project
